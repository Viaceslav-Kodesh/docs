To start work in VentusCloud portal firstly you need to create a new user account. So, let's start.
Following the home page of VentusCloud  - <https://portal.ventuscloud.eu/login>, you can see the next interface:

As you are not registered yet on VentusCloud portal you need to do this:

* click to **CREATE NEW ACCOUNT** 

* on the next page fill in the following form as shown below:  

![](../../assets/img/create_account/2ac.png)  

* check that you don't forget to indicate that you agree to the terms and conditions of VentusCloud portal and click the **SIGNED UP**

* on the next opened page you need: 
    * to duplicate the information you provided on the last page, such as: 
        - First name
        - Last name
        - Account e-mail adress
    * and provide additional information required for registration, such as:
        - Country
        - Adress
        - State
        - City
        - Zip Code
        - Phone
        
All fields that must be filled on this page are marked with an asterisk. Review the information you entered for this Account. If it is correct, select **ADD CLIENT BILLING INFORMATION**. 

After that, your new account is considered as registered. So, when you will visit home page of VentusCloud for the second time, you will need to indicate only **User name** (it is equal to your email address specified during registration) and **Password**. 

Next steps to get started in VentusCloud portal will be related to the choice of your payment system, but we will consider them in the next quickstart.
